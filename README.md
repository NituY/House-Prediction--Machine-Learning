# House-Prediction--Machine-Learning
A machine learning project to predict the house price based on data on Housing Prices in Banglore


House Price Prediction is an analytical model based on the House-Price dataset. This project involves creating a machine learning model that aims to predict house prices based on the features provided in the dataset. The goal is to accurately predict house prices using the given attributes.

## Feature of Dataset
1	Id =	To count the records.\
2	MSSubClass =	 Identifies the type of dwelling involved in the sale.\
3	MSZoning =	Identifies the general zoning classification of the sale.\
4	LotArea =	 Lot size in square feet. \
5	LotConfig =	Configuration of the lot \
6	BldgType =	Type of dwelling \
7	OverallCond =	Rates the overall condition of the house \
8	YearBuilt =	Original construction year \
9	YearRemodAdd =	Remodel date (same as construction date if no remodeling or additions). \
10	Exterior1st =	Exterior covering on the house \
11	BsmtFinSF2 =	Type 2 finished square feet. \
12	TotalBsmtSF =	Total square feet of the basement area \
13	SalePrice =	To be predicted \
